# SDN_divide_strings_and_reorder

if we divide a string (randomly across servers, and than randomly getting it back, by storing server indexes we can "reoder" and "rebuild" our string) by encrypting the parts of it between servers and getting it back, we don't really need
to encrypt our string at the client's side (saving resources)
